In this report, I aim to study the detail numerical statistic of Database marketplace,
which are price range, mean, median price of each type of products and all items in
the whole dataset. Given a JSON dataset, scrapping and crawling the whole marketplace website
by Juha Nurmi and others, I developed and extracted more key fields which are
very informative in grouping product types and generating statistical results.
Based on the analytical results, I observe that the average price of products
traded in Database marketplace is not very high, affordable for most of buyers.
In addition, personal information and banking/credit data are widely sold on
the dark marketplace. Those sensitive data is highly possible leaked from major
data breaches. Without raising the awareness of securing personal data,
more people will suffer increasingly financial and mental damage.
