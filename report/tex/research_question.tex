Database marketplace sells access to online compromised accounts and other
credential information which can be used for deleterious purposes. For example,
buyers can use sold credit cards to purchase their debts or online items. Another
scenario is that a criminal can utilize personal information to borrow money from
banks, or to make fraudulent health insurance claims\cite{web:personal_info_darkweb}.
Hence, personal data is an attractive item on dark webs, and the breach of it has the
significant impact on society in the financial perspective. In this study, I will
explore the wide range of sensitive data sold on Database marketplace, revealing a
detail picture of stolen personal data sold on the hidden Tor network through the
following research questions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item What types of stolen information are traded?\label{rq:type}
    \item What are the prices for different product types?\label{rq:price}
    \item Where the stolen information is from?\label{rq:where}
    \item What we can learn about the sellers?\label{rq:seller}
\end{itemize}
